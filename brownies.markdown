Source: I'm sure I got it from somewhere but I can't remember where.

### Ingredients
* 200g Dark Chocolate [The darker the better. 70%+]
* 175g Unsalted Butter
* 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
* 325g Caster Sugar
* 170g Plain Flour
* 3 Medium Eggs

### Method
1. Preheat [fan] oven to 170Â°c.
2. Melt the chocolate and butter on a very low heat (as low as your hob will go) in a small saucepan, stirring gently. [Most recipes tell you to do something complicated with a water bath to melt chocolate but I find this works fine as long as you use a low enough heat.] When fully melted, pour into a mixing bowl. 
3. Add vanilla and stir a little bit. Add sugar and stir until well mixed. Add flour and stir until well mixed [it goes really thick at this point, don't worry]. Add eggs one at a time, mixing in each one. You should end up with a nice smooth brownie mix.
4. Pour into a tray/cake tin lined with greaseproof paper. You're aiming for around 2-3 cm depth. A big square tray is ideal but I've used weird things like 2 smaller round cake tins. Spread with a spoon or knife so the mixture is evenly spread and roughly flat.
5. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Poke with a sharp knife, if it comes out clean it's done. Undercooked is better than overcooked!
6. Leave to cool and set for a long time, preferably overnight. Cut up into squares and serve.

### Variations
For a twist use a different type of chocolate like choc w/ orange. 

I have also tried substituting some caster sugar with light brown sugar and they came out just as well.
