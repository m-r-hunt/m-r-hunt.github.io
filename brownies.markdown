Source: I'm sure I got it from somewhere but I can't remember where.

### Ingredients
* 200g Dark Chocolate [The darker the better. I used Asda dark chocolate which acquitted itself well.]
* 175g Unsalted Butter
* 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
* 325g Caster Sugar
* 170g Plain Flour
* 3 Medium Eggs

### Method
1. Preheat [fan] oven to 170Â°c.
2. Melt the chocolate and butter on a very low heat in a small saucepan, stirring gently. [Most recipes tell you to do something complicated with a water bath but I find this works fine as long as you use a low enough heat.] When fully melted, pour into a mixing bowl. Add vanilla and stir a little bit. Add sugar and stir until well mixed. Add flour and stir until well mixed [it goes really thick at this point, don't worry]. Add eggs one at a time, mixing in each one. You should end up with a nice smooth brownie mix.
3. Pour into a lined tray/cake tin. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Poke with a sharp knife, if it comes out clean it's done. Undercooked is better than overcooked!
4. Leave to cool and set for a long time, preferably overnight. Cut up into squares and serve.

### Variations
For a twist use a different type of chocolate like choc w/ orange.
