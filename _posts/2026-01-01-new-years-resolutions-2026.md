Here's the plan this year:

## 1 - Work on my game project

I am once again trying to stick to a spare time game project for more than like a month. The project I've got has some setup to go down different technical angles and hopefully keep it interesting.

I have some history with trying to do things every day and I find it leads to burnout where when I finally take a break I just never touch it again. So my plan is to use a slightly different structure:

In odd months (January, March, ...) I will work on the project at least a little bit every day.

In even months (February, April, ...) I will make time for at least 1 decent 1 hour+ session every week.

We'll see if this works well.

## 2 - Wear my smartwatch

I've had this thing for ages but I have not been good at wearing it.

Part 1 is to wear it every day. Part 2 is to complete the fitness goal ring things every day. I have these set to quite a low level but I may bump it up at some point.


## 3 - Watch a move every week

Yes I'm running this back (from 2024). I ended up not really watching many movies again in 2025. I'm adding one additional piece of structure which is that I'm going to have a letter of the alphabet per week. 

In the first week of the year I'll watch a film beginning with the letter A, in week 2 the letter B, etc.

This means I should loop through the alphabet twice in 52 weeks which has a pleasing structure.

## Tracking

I want all my goals to be trackable and to create a report at the end of the year with the data. Here's how this will work per goal:

1. I plan to make one really long blogpost which I keep updating with progress on this as a form of diary. I can look back at this to check consistency.

2. I can look at the data that the watch tracks to check my progress on this.

3. As always I log my film watching and review everything on pretentious cinephile social media site Letterboxd so I will be able to see a record of my film watching there.

See you in a year for the wrap up.
