## General Rules

This is mainly designed around single player games that you can finish (in a reasonably finite length of time). The criteria for ticking off a square is that you "beat the game". It's hard to define this in a way that works for every game, but roughly this means "when an Any% speedrun would be finished/usually when the end credits play if the game has them and it's not some kind of a gimmick ending". But I'm sure you can find examples of games that break this definition somehow, so in that case follow your heart.

I'm not putting a hard rule in for "no replaying games you've already played" because I think it will make life hard for myself in particular on a few squares. But you're definitely encouraged to play new games.

The basic categories for each square are designed to be not-too-hard to fulfill with a lot of different games, although they definitely vary in specificity. Each square has a "hard mode" which will be significantly harder for fulfil. Hard mode is just for fun/if you feel like it.

The bingo period is one year from publication of this post: 14/04/24-14/04/25. I have no idea how likely it is for me (or anyone else) to finish a full card in that time.

## The Card

## Long List

Here's a more complete definition of each square, along with a hard mode criteria for each one. 

I've provided a few examples for each square, there are definitely more for all of them and if you need help I can come up with some more. I tried to include examples that would be fairly accessible on different platforms etc. I also used the same examples in multiple places because, let's be honest, when you've thought of something once it's easier to think of it again.
