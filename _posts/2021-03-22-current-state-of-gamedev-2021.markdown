It's been almost exactly a year since the [last one of these]({{site.url}}/blog/gamedev/current-state-of-gamedev), so I thought I'd do another one and maintain some vague attempt at consistency in updates/writing (lol).

## Game Jam Projects

I continued to do a lot of game jam projects this year. Here's a full list with some thoughts in retrospect:

* [Wormy](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/wormy) - Made for a very short timeframe jam (4 hours divided up over a weekend). I was really happy with how this came out and the amound I got done. Doesn't seem to have made as much of a splash with anyone else.

* [Fossil Hunter](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/fossil-hunter) - Another one that I'm pretty happy with. The graphics/sound and sense of an explorable world is something that stands out compared to a lot of other stuff I've done. I think because of that this is maybe the game I'd most like to draw on going forward.

* [Bear Necessities](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/bear-necessities) - Another relatively short jam, this is an arcadey game that has a little fun to it I think but not much depth.

* [Unititled Mini Micro RTS](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/untitled-mini-micro-rts) - This was one of two "failures", i.e. game jam projects where I didn't really end up with a product I was happy with. I entered this jam but ended up not liking Mini Micro for various reasons and didn't end up with much. I might revisit the ideas here at some point with better tech.

* [Sliderz](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/sliderz) - The idea of making a game about a "fantasy interface" is something that's been in my head for a while. It was good to get it out and explore some of the ideas, and I do like how this came out although it's probably a bit short and simple.

* [Rolling Sands](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/rolling-sands) - This was another failure, with some commonalities like a month long jam and new tech. Should really have tried to push on and get it more-or-less finished but maybe lockdown and wfh was getting to me.

* [The Exploits of Jimothy Jones](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/exploits-of-jimothy-jones) - Yet another short jam, this was also using some new-to-me tech, GB Studio, but went a lot better. Although I don't have much desire to make anything more with GB Studio, it was fun to explore and have a somewhat unique output (i.e. an actual Gameboy game).

* [Pawprints and Platforms](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/pawprints-and-platforms) - Broke out of my comfort zone significantly by making the leap into 3D and Unity. The end product wasn't amazing in terms of gameplay I think but I did get to explore some new ideas and tools, and did end up with a completed project.

* [Super Crate Smash](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/super-crate-smash) - Breaking out again with an Unreal game. This was a weird decision motivated by wanting to learn some basic Unreal to help out with a job interview. Well, it worked and I got the job. The actual resultant game is probably a bit mediocre, but inspired fierce competition to speedrun the game by a few friends. The current world record is a ridiculous [1:27.952 by robjbeasley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvNSA_KTwzQ).

* [Chargin' Chuck](https://mrhthepie.itch.io/chargin-chuck) - Another quicker weekend jam. Had some slightly original gameplay ideas and was reasonably happy with the end product. More speedrunning happened with the current records at [any% in 1:01 by robjbeasley](https://youtu.be/0LStmLH4iJY) and [100% in 1:29 by mobiusman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eibK6bSYYWw).
