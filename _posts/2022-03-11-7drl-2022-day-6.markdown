Day 6, the end is in sight.

## Even More Content

A lot of today was spent on implementing even more content. I added some more level layouts (could do with even more though). I also added several more activated abilities which should really improve variety across runs.

## Stretch Goal - Classes

I added selectable character classes when starting a run. This was a feature I always wanted to get it, but wasn't sure if I had time. In the end, it's a pretty stripped down version compared to some wild plans I had, but it works and changes your starting skill and name and portrait. Also 2 of the 3 are locked until you beat the game for the first time, which should hopefully encourage some replayability (roguelike dev pro tip - triple your playtime with this one weird trick).

## Bouncy Corpses

One little brainwave I had was to just... not despawn corpses (which were already bouncing around after death). This adds a little more physicsy chaos which fits with the general vibe of the game.

## Visuals and Branding

I tightened up the colour scheme of the level geometry/scenery. I also fixed up the branding stuff on the Itch.io page which means the game really is ready to roll now.

## Time Spent

I worked **8 hours** today. Feeling better today. Hopefully I've got the stamina to push through to the end tomorrow.

## Next Steps

Final day tomorrow. I have this list of things to knock out early:

After that it should be playtesting, with a focus on fixing any remaining bugs and balancing the game. I also solicited some last minute testing by some friends so I might be able to make some last minute changes based on anything that throws up.

And then finallly upload the last build, make the game page public, and submit to the jam. And then sleep.
