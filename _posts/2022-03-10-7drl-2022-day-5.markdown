On the 5th day of 7drl, my true love gave to me, five goooold coins.

## Polish

All of what I did today was polish features. My general finding with this has been that no individual polish task is important, but when you add all of them up it takes a game over the line from a janky prototype to something that starts to feel finished and good to play. So today I pretty much just burned through this list.

So no massive obvious improvements but a lot of things are just a little better and we're closer to really being good to play.

## Time Spent

I worked **6 hours** today. Woke up feeling kind of headachey and I've been tired all day so I'm finishing up early rather than working into the evening again. Hopefully will have a good amount of energy for tomorrow and Saturday.

## Next Steps

Pretty much on track as I said yesterday, so we're looking at:

* Friday - Even more content and stretch goals. Really need to focus on level layouts as that's the biggest thing that's currently lacking.
* Saturday - Final playtesting, bugfixing and balancing, and get it over the finish line
