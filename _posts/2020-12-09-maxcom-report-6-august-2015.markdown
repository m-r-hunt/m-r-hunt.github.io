We had a bit of a rough time for UFO interception this month. A continued stall on the new interceptor research (due to shortage of alien weapon fragments) meant we were still struggling to shoot down UFOs. One of them even took out the Satellite over the US, ultimately leading to them pulling out of the MaX-COM project. The council remains very down on our performance despite excellence in all other areas.

That said, we did finally research new interceptor technology midway through the month. Several new interceptors are being manufactured and should be ready in early September.

After extensive testing of almost the entire squad, we finally found our first psionic soldier in Jethro \_. We suspect that his abilities will be key to the fight ahead of us.

Our program of gene modifcation has been kicked into a higher gear now that we have slightly more resources to spare. Alex Spencer and Rob Beasley received some gene modifcations this month, and if time and resources can be spared we will continue augmenting our squad going forward. Dr. Shen has complained about having to remove the sleeves from all the suits of Titan Armour he just finished manufacturing, but that's a small price to pay for our increased effectiveness.

### Mission and Personnel Report

Our squad is really hitting hyper elite levels now. Despite some increased resistance from new alien species like Heavy Floaters, we've continued to dominate on the battlefield. Exalt in particular have proved pushovers.

Mission | Location | Squad
--------|----------|------
Operation Secret Rain | UFO Crash Site, Brazil | Sam Staton, Matt Rogers, Rob Beasley, Matt Smith, Robert Goss, Shivey McShivface

Operation Bloody Calm | Port Elizabeth, South Africa | Alex Spencer, Matt Smith, Matt Rogers, Sam Staton, Robert Goss, Shivey McShivface

Note: We performed 2 other operations this month, but records were lost. We suspect this was due to alien infiltration, and definitely not the commander forgetting to update his spreadsheet.
