My New Year's Resolution for 2024 was to watch at least one film per calendar week for the entire week. Here are some statistics on how it went.

## Headline

I watched 58 films in 2024. So on average I succeeded at my goal, but that wasn't the stated goal. I watched at least one film in 44 of the 53 calendar weeks of 2024, a success rate of 83%. I started off pretty strong for most of the year but really fell apart in November and December. I don't have a great reason for that, there were a few factors (OSRS Leagues V for example).

I watched the most films on a Friday or Saturday, and apparently I never watched any films on a Monday (plus only one on a Wednesday). This distribution surprised me a little, I would have though it was a more even spread on weekdays.

As for my ratings, the distribution came out roughly as I'd expect. There's a strong bias towards films being a "pretty good" 4 stars as I'm the one picking films I want to watch. Outliers from that fill up 3 and 5 stars, and then an occaisional unexpected stinker + bad movie nigh films fill out 1 and 2 stars.

## Hall of Fame and Shame

Here's a rough list of the 5 best films I watched. This is mostly the ones I gave 5 stars that have stuck with me the most:

* Dune 2
* The Menu
* Full Metal Jacket
* Deadpool & Wolverine
* Hell or High Water

And here are the 5 worst stinkers:

* Immortals
* X-Men Origins Wolverine
* Aladdin and the King of Thieves
* Dude, Whereâ€™s My Car?
* Next

## Movie Venues

Here's a quick summary of some of the ways I watched movies that weren't just sitting at home:

### Cinema

Not a big cinema year for me, only caught 4 things in the Cinema:

* Wonka
* Argylle
* Dune 2
* Deadpool & Wolverine

A couple of mediocre entries but also 2 of the best.

### Bad Movies Night

I caught 4 bad movie nights this year. Surprisingly good movies on average, not just bad ones this year (although this does cover most of the bad ones...)

* Next
* Source Code
* Super Mario Bros.
* Immortals
* Robin Hood: Men in Tights
* Spaceballs
* Weirld: The Al Yankovic Story
* First Strike

### Film Club

Part way through the year we started doing Film Club. Here are the films and ratings for that:

* The Shining *****
* About Time *****
* LA Confidential ****
* The Rocky Horror Picture Show ****
* Die Hard 2 ***

## Conclusion

This was a fun Resolution, and it did what I wanted: I watched more films this year than last year.

Actually in 2023 I managed to watch 50 which is more than I remembered, although the distribution of those was a lot more "clumpy" throughout the year since apparently in 2023 I had several film series binge watch sessions (Twilight, Star Wars Prequels, John Wick) and also went to more Bad Move Night sessions. So this year I watched more "good films"/watched more "unironically".

Need to figure out what silly challenge(s) for Resolutions I'm doing this year quite quickly, but they definitely won't be a repeat of last year...
